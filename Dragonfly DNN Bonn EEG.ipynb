Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[1m2/2\u001b[0m \u001b[32m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m\u001b[37m\u001b[0m \u001b[1m0s\u001b[0m 86ms/step\n","\n","--- Simplified Model Evaluation (2 Hidden Layers) ---\n","Test Accuracy: 1.0000\n","\n","Classification Report:\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           A       1.00      1.00      1.00        20\n","           D       1.00      1.00      1.00        20\n","           E       1.00      1.00      1.00        20\n","\n","    accuracy                           1.00        60\n","   macro avg       1.00      1.00      1.00        60\n","weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00        60\n","\n"]}],"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, BatchNormalization, Dropout\n","from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau, EarlyStopping\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","# Perform Train/Test Split using the selected features\n","# X_selected and y come from the previous cells\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_selected, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)\n","\n","print(f\"Training shape: {X_train.shape}, Test shape: {X_test.shape}\")\n","\n","# 1.
